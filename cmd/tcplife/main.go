/*
Program tcplife is a BCC tool created by Brendan Gregg to
summarize TCP sessions that open and close while tracing,
see https://github.com/iovisor/bcc/blob/master/tools/tcplife.py.
It traces the lifespan of TCP sessions showing their duration, address details,
throughput, the responsible process ID and name.

	TIME: The time of the session in seconds (timestamp), counting from the first event seen.
	PID: The process ID responsible for the connection.
	COMM: The process name responsible for the connection.
	LADDR: Local address.
	LPORT: Local port.
	RADDR: Remote address.
	RPORT: Remote port.
	TX_KB: Number of kilobytes transmitted during the connection.
	RX_KB: Number of kilobytes received during the connection.
	MS: Duration of the connection in milliseconds, i.e.,
		the time from the first state transition seen for the socket, to TCP_CLOSE.

This tool is useful for workload characterisation and flow accounting:
identifying what connections are happening, with the bytes transferred.
This works by tracing TCP socket state change events (sock:inet_sock_set_state tracepoint),
and prints the summary details when the state changes to TCP_CLOSE.
